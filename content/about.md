### Why Travel with us?

Discovering the outdoors starts with an outward journey that turns into inner self discovery; it’s a very personal and unique experience. Bad Goat Adventures’ aims to help our guests take their first—or maybe fifth—step to acknowledge this relationship between nature and themselves.

We understand that your adventure is special, and we focus on a personalized approach to each of our travels. Whether you are looking to gain a new skill, trying to discover new areas, or searching for something, we’re here to help guide you on your experience.

### Meet the Tribe

**Rachel**

Rachel’s outdoor experience is vast, ranging from mountain treks in high school, or working as a rock climbing instructor during summer in New Mexico. Rachel graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with a Bachelor degree in Global Studies. During that time and after, she worked at a local adventure tour company that guided trips to the Santa Cruz Islands. She also later worked at another adventure tour company in the San Francisco Bay Area while living there. Rachel currently is devoting her full time on growth and development of the company.

**Skyline**

Skyline was a late bloomer to the outdoors, starting with camping trips during college. After her first several experiences, she was hooked, and exponentially developed her knowledge and experience of backpacking, rock climbing, ice climbing, and skiing. Sky has completed the John Muir Trail in 17 days because she could not get more days off work, and paved the way for many climbers to start climbing outdoors.
